# Knight's Tour Robot

This project implements the classic "Knight's Tour" problem using a physical robot. This project combines both software and hardware design to make a robot physically execute the Knight's Tour on a custom 5x5 chessboard.

## Project Description

A knight in chess moves in an "L" shape—either two squares in one direction (Y) and one square in the perpendicular direction (X), or vice versa. The goal of the Knight's Tour is for the knight to visit every square on the board exactly once, starting from an arbitrary position.

This project consists of the following steps:

1. Solve the Knight's Tour virtually, generating a sequence of moves in memory.
2. Replay the computed moves to control a robot that physically traverses a 5x5 chessboard.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Starting Points**: The system supports any valid black square as the starting position.
- **Hardware-Software Integration**: The Knight’s Tour is computed virtually and then executed using a robot.
- **PID Controlled Motors, and IR sensors**: Motors are controlled using a PID controller, and IR sensors are used to detect the center of each square and correct the robot heading.

## System Architecture

The system is built using multiple Verilog modules, as shown in the diagram below:

### Module Overview:

1. **Inertial Interface (inert_int)**:
    - Handles orientation and heading information using data from the gyroscope.
    - Supports robot calibration and movement tracking.
2. **IR Interface (IR_int)**:
    - Monitors the robot's interaction with the board using IR sensors.
    - Detects obstacles or boundaries.
3. **Command Processor (cmd_proc)**:
    - Coordinates the solution's virtual computation and command generation for physical execution.
4. **Tour Command (TourCmd)**:
    - Converts the Knight's Tour solution into actionable movement commands.
    - Synchronizes robot movements with board navigation.
5. **Tour Logic (TourLogic)**:
    - Calculates the solution to the Knight's Tour problem based on the starting square.
    - Ensures the robot visits every square once.
6. **PID Controller (PID)**:
    - Controls motor speeds to ensure smooth and accurate movements.
7. **Motor Driver (MtrDrv)**:
    - Drives the motors using PWM signals for precise movement.
8. **UART Wrapper (UART_wrapper)**:
    - Manages communication with external devices, including a BLE module for wireless control.
9. **Reset Synchronizer (rst_synch)**:
    - Handles system resets to ensure consistent operation.
10. **Sponge Module (sponge)**:
    - Plays the last measure of the Sponge Bob Theme song between moves.

## How It Works

1. **Virtual Solution**:
    - The TourLogic module computes a valid Knight's Tour from the chosen starting square.
    - The solution is stored in memory and converted into a sequence of moves.
2. **Physical Execution**:
    - The robot receives movement commands generated by the cmd_proc and TourCmd modules.
    - PID control ensures precise navigation across the board.
    - IR sensors detect boundaries and verify positions during the tour.
3. **User Interaction**:
    - The system can be configured via UART and BLE for easy operation and monitoring.
